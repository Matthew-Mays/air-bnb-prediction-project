# Airbnb Price Prediction Project
## About the Project:
### Goals:
The main goal for this project is to create a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of US Airbnb listings. My own personal goal is to try and see if NLP based on the title of the listing can help in any way in predicting price.
### Data Dictionary:
The target variable for this project is price, the price of the Airbnb rental.
The features are as follows:
**Name:** The name the rental is listed as, ex. "Urban Getaway - Perfect Location"
**host_id:** The host's id number.
**host_name:** The host's name.
**neighborhood:** Which neighborhood the rental is in.
**latitude:** The latitude coordinate of the location.
**longitude:** The longitude coordinate of the location.
**room_type:** Designates whether the listing is for a single room, entire home/appartment, etc.
**minimum_nights:** How many days you must book the rental at a minimum.
**number_of_reviews:** How many reviews the rental has.
**last_review:** The date of the most recent review for the rental.
**reviews_per_month:** How many reviews the rental gets per month.
**calculated_host_listings_count:** Total number of listings by host.
**availability_365:** How many days in a year the listing is available to rent.
**city:** The city where the listing is located.
